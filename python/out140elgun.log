Please check that the jet algorithm and jet size match those used for the original jet collection and also make sure the original jets are uncorrected. In addition, make sure you are not using CaloJets which are presently not supported.
Since the mismatch is at low Pt (Pt<10 GeV), it is ignored and only a warning is issued.
